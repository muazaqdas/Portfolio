## üí° Application Strategy

### When Applying to TMPO:

#### 1. Opening Statement (First Impression)
```
I'm a React Native developer with 1+ year of professional experience leading
mobile development at Gatoes, where I built and deployed 2 production apps
(iOS + Android) serving 500+ daily active users. I managed a team of 3 developers
and owned features end-to-end from Figma designs to production deployment.

I'm excited about TMPO because I've already built AI-powered features using LLM
APIs (OpenRouter) for a healthcare chatbot, which directly aligns with your Claude
API integration work.
```

#### 2. Portfolio Highlight
```
My portfolio showcases:
‚Ä¢ 2 production mobile apps live in the App Store and Play Store
‚Ä¢ AI-powered chatbot with RAG architecture and LLM integration
‚Ä¢ Active React Native projects demonstrating continuous learning
‚Ä¢ Fullstack development experience with Node.js, MongoDB, API design

Portfolio: https://portfolio-muazaqdas.vercel.app/project
```

#### 3. Team Experience Emphasis
```
I've led a mobile development team for over a year, which aligns perfectly with
TMPO's goal of building a 3-developer team. I understand both individual
contribution and team collaboration, having:
‚Ä¢ Managed 3 interns from onboarding to feature delivery
‚Ä¢ Conducted code reviews and provided mentorship
‚Ä¢ Coordinated feature planning and sprint deliverables
‚Ä¢ Handled production incidents and crash report resolution
```

#### 4. Technical Alignment
```
Technical skills matching TMPO's stack:
‚úÖ React Native + TypeScript (1+ year production experience)
‚úÖ Expo (used for both Gatoes apps)
‚úÖ AI/LLM Integration (OpenRouter API for RAG chatbot)
‚úÖ Backend platforms (Node.js, MongoDB - similar to Supabase architecture)
‚úÖ API integrations (Razorpay payments, Zoho chat, Socket.io real-time)
‚úÖ App Store & Play Store deployment and maintenance
```

#### 5. Self-Driven Nature
```
Examples of initiative:
‚Ä¢ Built Gatoes user app from scratch without prior mobile experience
‚Ä¢ Currently developing expense tracker app (Splitwise clone) in spare time
‚Ä¢ Optimized API response times by 80% through strategic caching
‚Ä¢ Wrote comprehensive API documentation for team knowledge sharing
‚Ä¢ Resolved production crashes independently using crash analytics
```
